# department-employee-manager-c
Dynamic memory-based department and employee management system written in C using structs, pointers, and file operations.
# Dynamic Department and Employee Management System (C Project)

This project was developed in C using concepts such as `struct`, dynamic memory management, pointers, and file operations.

## Features
- Create and manage departments and employees using dynamic arrays.
- Calculate average salaries and find the highest-paid employee.
- Read and write all data from/to files using standard file I/O.
- Modular design: code is separated into `main.c`, `Proje1.c`, and `Proje1.h`.
- Includes a Makefile for compilation.

## Educational Goals
This project helped me practice:
- Using structs for grouping related data.
- Managing memory with `malloc`, `realloc`, and `free`.
- Reading/writing files with `fopen`, `fprintf`, `fscanf`, etc.
- Pointer manipulation, including double pointers for dynamic structures.

## How to Compile
```bash
make

How to Run
./main
